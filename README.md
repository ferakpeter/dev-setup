dev-setup
============

## Installation

##### Clone the Repo

    $ git clone https://github.com/ferakpeter/dev-setup.git && cd dev-setup

##### Run the .dots Script with Command Line Arguments

**Since you probably don't want to install every section**, the `.dots` script supports command line arguments to run only specified sections.  Simply pass in the [scripts](#scripts) that you want to install.  Below are some examples.

**For more customization, you can [clone](#clone-the-repo) or [fork](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork) the repo and tweak the `.dots` script and its associated components to suit your needs.**

Run all:

    $ ./.dots all

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx

Run `bootstrap.sh`, `osxprep.sh`, `brew.sh`, and `osx.sh`, `aws.sh`, and `datastores.sh`:

    $ ./.dots bootstrap osxprep brew osx aws datastores

#### Running without Git

    $ curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ferakpeter/dev-setup/master/.dots && ./.dots [Add ARGS Here]

* When installing the Xcode command line tools, a dialog box will confirm installation.
    * Once Xcode is installed, follow the instructions on the terminal to continue.
* `.dots` runs `brew.sh`, which takes awhile to complete as some formulae need to be installed from source.
* **When `.dots` completes, be sure to restart your computer for all updates to take effect.**

I encourage you to read through Section 1 so you have a better idea of what each installation script does.  The following discussions describe in greater detail what is executed when running the [.dots](https://github.com/ferakpeter/dev-setup/blob/master/.dots) script.

### bootstrap.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/commands.png">
  <br/>
</p>

The `bootstrap.sh` script will sync the dev-setup repo to your local home directory.  This will include customizations for Vim, bash, curl, git, tab completion, aliases, a number of utility functions, etc.  Section 2 of this repo describes some of the customizations.

#### Running with Git

First, fork or [clone the repo](#clone-the-repo).  The `bootstrap.sh` script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder `~`:

    $ source bootstrap.sh

To update later on, just run that command again.

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

    $ set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh

#### Running without Git

To sync dev-setup to your local home directory without Git, run the following:

    $ cd ~; curl -#L https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh,LICENSE}

To update later on, just run that command again.

#### Optional: Specify PATH

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files before any feature testing (such as detecting which version of `ls` is being used takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `/usr/local/bin` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Optional: Add Custom Commands

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# Git credentials
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Donne Martin"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="donne.martin@gmail.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Pip should only run if there is a virtualenv currently activated
export PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=true

# Install or upgrade a global package
# Usage: gpip install –upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv
gpip(){
   PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV="" pip "$@"
}
```

You could also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions, and aliases from the dev-setup repository, although it’s probably better to [fork the dev-setup repository](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/fork).

### osxprep.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/xcode.jpg">
  <br/>
</p>

Run the `osxprep.sh` script:

    $ ./osxprep.sh

`osxprep.sh` will first install all updates.  If a restart is required, simply run the script again.  Once all updates are installed, `osxprep.sh` will then [Install Xcode Command Line Tools](#install-xcode-command-line-tools).

If you want to go the manual route, you can also install all updates by running "App Store", selecting the "Updates" icon, then updating both the OS and installed apps.

#### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

An important dependency before many tools such as Homebrew can work is the **Command Line Tools for Xcode**. These include compilers like gcc that will allow you to build from source.

If you are running **OS X 10.9 Mavericks or later**, then you can install the Xcode Command Line Tools directly from the command line with:

    $ xcode-select --install

**Note**: the `osxprep.sh` script executes this command.

Running the command above will display a dialog where you can either:
* Install Xcode and the command line tools
* Install the command line tools only
* Cancel the install

##### OS X 10.8 and Older

If you're running 10.8 or older, you'll need to go to [http://developer.apple.com/downloads](http://developer.apple.com/downloads), and sign in with your Apple ID (the same one you use for iTunes and app purchases). Unfortunately, you're greeted by a rather annoying questionnaire. All questions are required, so feel free to answer at random.

Once you reach the downloads page, search for "command line tools", and download the latest **Command Line Tools (OS X Mountain Lion) for Xcode**. Open the **.dmg** file once it's done downloading, and double-click on the **.mpkg** installer to launch the installation. When it's done, you can unmount the disk in Finder.

### brew.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/homebrew2.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), a package manager that simplifies installing and updating applications or libraries.

Some of the apps installed by the `brew.sh` script include: Chrome, Firefox, Sublime Text, Atom, Dropbox, Evernote, Skype, Slack, Alfred, VirtualBox, Vagrant, Docker, etc.  **For a full listing of installed formulae and apps, refer to the commented [brew.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/brew.sh) directly and tweak it to suit your needs.**

Run the `brew.sh` script:

    $ ./brew.sh

The `brew.sh` script takes awhile to complete, as some formulae need to be installed from source.

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal**

### osx.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/osx.png">
  <br/>
</p>

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set OS X defaults geared towards developers.  The `osx.sh` script also configures common third-party apps such Sublime Text and Chrome.

**Note**: **I strongly encourage you read through the commented [osx.sh source file](https://github.com/donnemartin/dev-setup/blob/master/osx.sh) and tweak any settings based on your personal preferences.  The script defaults are intended for you to customize.**  For example, if you are not running an SSD you might want to change some of the settings listed in the SSD section.

Run the `osx.sh` script:

    $ ./osx.sh

**For your terminal customization to take full effect, quit and re-start the terminal.**

### aws.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/aws.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a development environment to work with Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and Amazon Web Services, run the `aws.sh` script:

    $ ./aws.sh

### datastores.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/datastores.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up common data stores, run the `datastores.sh` script:

    $ ./datastores.sh

### web.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/webdev.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up a JavaScript web development environment, Run the `web.sh` script:

    $ ./web.sh

### android.sh script

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/donnemartin/dev-setup-resources/master/res/android.png">
  <br/>
</p>

To set up an Android development environment, run the `android.sh` script:

    $ ./android.sh
